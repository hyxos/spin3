# Spin³

**Rotational flow and quaternion animation for higher-dimensional geometry.**

---

## Status

_This is a planned subproject of the [Shard³](https://github.com/hyxos/shard3) ecosystem.  
Spin³ is not yet in active development._

---

## Overview

Spin³ will provide tools and visualizations for exploring rotation, flow, and quaternion animation in higher-dimensional spaces. The project will build on shared Hyxos Media architecture and modern web technologies.

If you are interested in contributing ideas or helping shape the direction of Spin³, please watch this repository or open a discussion in the [Shard³ metaproject](https://github.com/hyxos/shard3/discussions).
